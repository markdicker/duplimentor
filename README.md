# Duplimentor

Creates an archive of pages and Elementor templates that can then be imported into an existing WP installation.  Copies all meta data used by Elementor.

### The Problem

Often when developing a new theme we'll take a copy of a site so that we cn check that our changes still work with the existing data.  The traditional way to create a new design required you to modify the PHP files in a theme to match your design.  Elementor changes this by storing it's page layouts in the wordpress wp_post table.  The new design does not physically exist in PHP/CSS/JS files, which means you cannot just upload your new theme to a site.  

This is even more true if the site is an ecommerce site.  If the site is in use during development then many of the new database records will have the same ID as the new Elementor data records.  We cannot just export the database and import over the top of the site as that could (most likely will) delete data.  In an eCommerce system this could be lost sales data.  

### My Solution

Duplimentor attempts to solve this issue by adding or updating pages in the same way that they would done by hand.  The backup archive contains all the details needed to recreate an elementor page/template.

This could break your website so make a backup and don't blindly use it on a production site.  As are most open source projects, it was developed to solve my own need and may not work for you.
